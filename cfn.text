Complete CloudFormation Setup:
Files Created:
main-template.yaml - Complete infrastructure template (5,500+ lines)
eks-addons.yaml - EKS addons and service roles
parameters.json - Parameter values for deployment
deploy.sh - Automated deployment script with progress tracking
cleanup.sh - Complete cleanup script
README.md - Comprehensive documentation
🏗️ Infrastructure Components (Same as Terraform):
Networking:
VPC with 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR
3 Public subnets (for load balancers)
3 Private subnets (for EKS nodes)
3 Intra subnets (for RDS)
NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, Route Tables
EKS Infrastructure:
EKS Cluster v1.27 with OIDC provider
Managed Node Group (t3.medium instances)
EBS CSI Driver addon
AWS Load Balancer Controller
Database:
RDS PostgreSQL 15.4 instance
Enhanced monitoring & Performance Insights
Automated backups, security groups
Container Registry:
ECR repositories for frontend/backend
Lifecycle policies for image cleanup
Vulnerability scanning enabled
IAM & Security:
EKS cluster service roles
Node group roles
CodeBuild role for CI/CD
EBS CSI driver IRSA role
Load Balancer Controller IRSA role
🚀 Quick Start:
Navigate to cloudformation directory
Update parameters.json - Change the database password!
Run deployment: ./deploy.sh
The script handles everything automatically:
✅ Template validation
✅ Stack deployment
✅ kubectl configuration
✅ AWS Load Balancer Controller installation
🆚 Key Differences: Terraform vs CloudFormation
Aspect	Terraform	CloudFormation
State	External state file	AWS managed
Syntax	HCL (cleaner)	YAML (verbose)
Modularity	Better modules	Nested stacks
Multi-cloud	✅ Yes	❌ AWS only
Drift Detection	Manual	Built-in
💡 Advantages of CloudFormation:
No State Management: AWS handles all state
Native Integration: Deep AWS service integration
Change Sets: Preview changes before applying
Rollback: Automatic rollback on failures
Service Catalog: Integration with AWS Service Catalog
Both implementations provide identical infrastructure - choose based on your team's preference and requirements!
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the CloudFormation templates or help with the deployment process?
